## What is Open Source? 

***

>One of the most popular terms among the top technology organizations is __"Open Source."__ Both ___"Open"___ and ___"Source"___ are terms. Something that is in the form of source—as in, "source code"—and is "openly" accessible to everyone—could be interpreted in a very simple and plausible way. However, that is only another method of analyzing it purely based on words. Let's investigate the actual situation.


Open source software is those that the software's developer makes accessible to users and developers globally, permitting individuals to alter, add to, or recommend changes to the software. Open source has developed into a movement and a method of operation that goes beyond the development of software. The open-source movement looks for novel methods to address issues in their communities and industries by drawing on the principles and centralized manufacturing model of open-source software. All of the technology we use for living and working is subtly supported by the open-source movement. Open source is more than simply technology or a license; it's about cultivating a spirit of collaboration and engagement where everyone can make a positive impact in the world.



## What is the Global Impact of Open Source?

***

As we are all aware, developers are found across the world. The process of developing software necessitates the sharing of information, opinions, and suggestions. For continuous input and suggestions from all across the world, developers make their applications open source. The concept of open source has been around for a very long time. In today's mostly all the popular software are open source. 
Now the question arises what is the benefit of the company to make their software FOSS?
Well, it is quite simple who in the world does not like easy collaborations, cost-effective tools and constant feedback that's why Open Source are used widely. 

Open-source software has undeniably had a significant impact on the industry in recent years. The development of the software industry has been significantly aided by open-source software, which gives companies of all sizes access to cutting-edge tools and technologies for a fraction of the price. Businesses may now compete in markets they previously would not have had access to thanks to open-source software, which also enables them to innovate more quickly and effectively than ever. Open-source software has shown to be a priceless resource for organizations since it lowers development costs and accelerates innovation.


### <u> Let's dig a little deeper into making your software Open Source </u>

##### 1.Collaboration and communication between developers has been enhanced
>The way developers cooperate and communicate has been changed by open source software. It has made it possible for developers to collaborate at a previously unheard-of level, working on projects from various locations and combining their various skill sets to provide more creative solutions. The open-source community has also made it easier for engineers to collaborate and share their knowledge, which has sped up issue resolution and improved problem-solving. In the end, these developments have helped businesses save more money and produce better products with shorter time-to-market.

##### 2.Increased software accessibility for both customers and companies
>The greater availability of high-quality software for organizations and individuals has been one of open-source software's most significant effects. A wide variety of software is now more widely available to everyone because to open source software's huge reduction in acquisition costs. This has made it possible for more people and enterprises to affordably use innovative software solutions. Access to high-quality software has had a wide range of effects, from enhanced invention and creativity to increased productivity and efficiency.

##### 3.Cost Savings
>Open source software can be more cost-effective for organizations, as they don't need to pay licensing fees. This can be particularly beneficial for smaller businesses or startups with limited budgets.Due to the absence of licensing costs, open source solutions enable businesses to cut the cost of software while maintaining the same level of service. This has had a significant impact on the market, enabling software solutions to be more affordable for companies of all kinds.

##### 4.Improved access to a greater developer and engineering skill pool
>Companies now have greater access to a talent pool of developers and engineers with a variety of talents and expertise thanks to the adoption of open source software. Due to the ability to access a bigger pool of technical expertise, businesses are now better able to find the talent and abilities necessary to complete their particular project requirements. Additionally, businesses have been able to create more creative and economical solutions to their technical needs thanks to open source software. Companies have been able to produce high-quality products more quickly and affordably by utilizing the varied and international talent pool.

##### 5. Enhanced security due to the frequent peer evaluation of open-source software
>One of the main advantages of open-source software is enhanced security. Peer review is possible because the source code is open to the public. This implies that any possible defects or security holes can be rapidly found and fixed before they cause a problem. Users can offer advice and suggestions on how to use the software safely and securely on a platform provided by the open-source community. Users' data and privacy are protected while a more secure environment is created for them.

## Why contributing to Open Source is Important for Software Developers?

***

Well, it makes no difference if you are new to software development or have been doing it for some time. For software developers, contributions to open source projects are equally important.Open Source has become the instrument that may completely direct and assist a software developer. Contributing to open source can initially seem intimidating and overwhelming. But nothing is more enjoyable than that as one gradually gains knowledge of the tools and appreciates their significance. 

_"My first exposure to contributing to open source as a software developer was during my first year of college.I was unable to comprehend anything. I questioned myself, **"Why am I doing this?"** However, after doing some research, I discovered that this emerging technology can help me in every aspect. That I have tried to include in this blog."_
