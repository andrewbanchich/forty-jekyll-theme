	<li>We are happy to share a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.13.520202v1"> new preprint manuscript</a>, in which we examined the covariation between boldness and avoidance foraging behavior, as well as how learning affected behavioral variation, in a generalist lizard predator. This study was a collaborative effort between Chi and two undergrad members of the lab, Hao-En Chin and Yu-Che Wu.</li>    
	<li>Chi gave a talk at the Department of Life Sciences at National Taiwan Normal University. Lots of great discussions!</li>
	<li>Hao-En and Hui-Chi presented their summer projects at the campus-wide poster competition. They’ve been working hard all summer, and we are very proud of what they’ve accomplished!</li>
