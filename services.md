<h2 id="content">Mobile Development</h2>
<p>My main focus lies on mobile development, especially <b>Android</b> and <b>Flutter</b>. I have worked over 6 years in mobile development environments. During this time I've had contact which almost every part of the Android system, worked on reactive development with <b>RxJava</b> and worked for two years with <b>Kotlin</b>.</p>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/Android_Robot_200.png" alt="" /></span>Since 2013, I've worked on several native Android project in eCommerce, culture, insurance and aviation. My focus is testability, architecture and performance. I've worked on <b>Instant App</b> and modular app project as well. During one of my last projects while I was working for REWE Digital GmbH, my colleague and I built a new dependency framework for Kotlin called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rewe-digital/katana">Katana</a>. I aim to deliver purely testable code, which can be achieved with <b>Clean Architecture</b> and strict modulization of features. I can support you and your team with my knowledge in how to start from scratch or to refactor savely, if required.</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/flutter.png" alt="" /></span>During the early 2018, Flutter caught my attention. The idea to have a cross plattform toolchain, which compiles to native code without having to use a bridge as e.g. in React Native sounded too good to be true. Flutter does an amazing job. You can quickly build polished and animated apps for both <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b>. I did a few case studies to test out it's limits and compared it to native implementations in Android. If you want to focus on your brand, Flutter should be a consideration. Since I've worked on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rewe-digital/katana">Katana</a>, I had to port it to <b>Dart</b>. The project is called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/matthiasbruns/dartana">Dartana</a> and will be released soon.</p>

<h2 id="content">Game Development</h2>
<p>Besides being and mobile developer, I always wanted to build games. I am a hobbiest since 2012 and will always be.</p>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/unity-3d-vector-icon-logo.png" alt="" /></span>I'd started to work with Unity as a hobby in 2012 even before I worked as a professional developer. During my studies I built a Zelda clone and since 2012 several prototypes. I've also finished a few courses online and attended the Unite 2018 in Berlin. I know what you need to build a game and how you structure components.
